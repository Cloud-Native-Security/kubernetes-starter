# Getting Started with Kubernetes

Often, when we are talking about Kubernetes & Kubernetes security, we are ignoring that lots of people are still in the process of getting started with the tech.
The cloud native space is a very young ecosystem that is constantly evolving. Naturally, we will encounter and work with community members, who are learning about Kubernetes and want to afvance their skills into the cloud native ecosystem.

In this respository, we are going to provide a simple starter guide. It will be focused on practical steps, showing the technology based on example scenarios.

### List of scenarios to get started with Kubernetes

* [Scenario One](./kubernetes/scenario-one.md): Setting up a Kubernetes demo environment
* [Scenario Two](./kubernetes/scenario-two.md): Looking at the different Kubernetes cluster components
* [Scenario Three](./kubernetes/scenario-three.md): Understanding the process of deploying a container to a Kubernetes cluster
* [Scenario Four](./kubernetes/scenario-four.md): Understanding different Kubernetes resource definitions

Each section references additional resources.

## Contributing

This is a generic repository, it does not aim to showcase specific projects unless those are heavily used across the industry; such as Helm.
We do welcome additional scenarios and enhancements to existing scenarios. 

The goal is to keep these scenarios up-to-date.
